      Star Brand Organic has been fostering the culture of organic farming since
      2004. We have over 75,000 acres of certified land and our 200+ products
      are now available in over 17 countries around the world. We follow Vedic
      as well as Biodynamic methods of farming wherein crops are grown with the
      help of bio-mechanism. We promote sustainability in agriculture by
      maintaining harmony between needs of farmers, customers and nature thus
      supporting the entire chain of healthy farming and living. Our name itself
      means prosperity which we strive to achieve for all our stakeholders,
      through sustenance and conscious growth. We believe in Samruddhi for the
      farmer, the consumer and the planet. We believe in health & harmony,
      within and beyond! The various activities of Samruddhi are being driven
      through its five important channels viz. Food, Fertility, Fibre, Fodder
      and Fuel. By following the process of 5Fs we have triggered the Samruddhi
      chain, a unique international network for the production and distribution
      of quality agricultural products subscribing to the strictest ecological
      and social standards.
